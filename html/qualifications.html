                        My areas of interest include Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) because this is an ever-growing field that has very few ethical voices within it.
                        I fully believe AI and ML are the most useful tool of our day, but just like everything else in this world, there are atrocious people who also use and create it.
                        We need people with a strong moral code and ethical values to be voices of reason within AI and ML. Scams involving deep fake images and recordings are already 
                        taking place, and it is likely only going to get worse. However, if genuinely good, moral people go into this field and speak up, change can and will occur. Development
                        of deep learning models, like ChatGPT, can have actual oversight to keep fraud from going rampant. I pray I can be one of the voices that make a change.

                    <div class="card_content">
                        I originally became interested in AI and ML after hearing a talk from Dr. John Lennox, a world renowned scholar and Christian. He spoke of the ways China uses AI to control its people.
                        Everywhere they go, everything they do, it is monitor by AI. As Lennox put it, "They are in a digital prison." I felt a calling from God that night. God wants me to help be 
                        a moral voice in AI. From that day on I shifted my focus towards Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Mathematics, pushing towards the goal of making a difference in
                        our world. It's not an easy path, I know this, but it's a necessary path, for me, and for many others.

                        Other areas of interest are space travel and exploration. I have been fascinated with rockets since I was kid. Prior to pursuing Computer Science, I wanted to be an Aerospace
                        Engineer. While it's no longer my focus, it's still an interest that I hope I can pursue from within the realm of computer Science.
