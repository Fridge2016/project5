                    AEGIS PAC3 Integration
                </div>
                <div class="card_content">
                    During summer '23, I interned at Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control in Grand Prairie. I worked on the AEGIS PAC3 project. 
                    The goal of this project is to allow Lockheed Martin's PAC3 Missile to be launched from a Military Ship.
                    I worked on a small Software Engineering team to perfect the software that controls the missiles. 
                    I was specifically tasked with updating the primary data structure driving the entire program.

                <div class="card_content">
                    This was an application that I created for my Programming Languages class, CSCE-314. We were tasked with creating a GUI out of Java and JavaFX 
                    that was used to search through the Attendance Record for a given class. All student and class data was fictional, as the purpose of the project 
                    was to learn about creating a GUI and to learn about an Object Oriented Programming Language like Java.

                    The website you are currently viewing was a project for my Programming Studio class, CSCE-315. I worked to create a fully functioning website
                    that would be hosted on Texas A&M's servers. The purpose of the project was to teach us about front-end development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
                    storing a project on GitHub.

                    The Stochastic Geomechanics Laboratory is a research lab at Texas A&M. I was a part of the undergraduate research team. We were tasked with
                    finding data and creating a Bayesian Network Model to predict the risk factor of various US-Canada-Mexico Supply Chains. I was specifically on the
                    Gulf of Mexico Research Team. I learned valuable skills in research, data processing via python, and the creation of interactive maps.
